# Technical Roundtable: Viral-Veo Demo Strategy

**Participants**: Carl (You), Senior Backend Engineer, ML Engineer, DevOps Engineer

## **Senior Backend Engineer**:
"Carl, I've looked at your code. The Remotion integration is impressive, but in a 2-minute demo, judges won't understand the technical complexity. You need to show the architecture visually. Don't just say 'cloud pipeline' - show the actual flow."

## **Carl**:
"Good point. Should I open the network tab to show the API calls?"

## **ML Engineer**:
"No, that's too in-the-weeds. But you MUST emphasize that you're using Veo-3, not some basic model. Most hackathon projects use Stable Diffusion or older models. Veo-3 is Google's latest - that's cutting edge. Also, show the prompt enhancement in action. Run a before/after comparison live."

## **DevOps Engineer**:
"The YouTube integration is your killer feature. Most projects end at 'here's my AI output.' You have REAL cloud infrastructure - GCS, OAuth, automated publishing. But don't just talk about it. Show the actual YouTube upload happening. Even if you fake it due to quota, show the modal, show the metadata fields."

## **Senior Backend Engineer**:
"One concern - you're spending too much time on the video editor. Judges at a hackathon want to see innovation speed, not feature completeness. Show the editor briefly, but focus on the pipeline. The fact that you go from prompt to published YouTube video in one flow - that's your differentiator."

## **ML Engineer**:
"Agree. Also, call out specific technical challenges you solved:
- Real-time video processing with FFmpeg
- OAuth token management
- Remotion server-side rendering
- Multi-format video export
These aren't trivial problems."

## **DevOps Engineer**:
"Add a terminal window showing the system running. Even if briefly. Judges need to see this is real infrastructure, not just a frontend demo. Show the Express server logs, show the file uploads happening."

## **Carl**:
"So focus more on the technical architecture and less on the user experience?"

## **Senior Backend Engineer**:
"Balance both. Start with the wow factor (your viral video), but then immediately dive into 'here's the technical challenge I solved' and show the complete pipeline working. End with the business impact."

## **Technical Consensus**:
1. **Visual Architecture**: Show system diagram or flow
2. **Live Technical Demo**: Show actual API calls, server responses
3. **Emphasize Cutting-Edge**: Veo-3, not basic models
4. **Problem Complexity**: Highlight non-trivial technical challenges solved
5. **Real Infrastructure**: Show actual deployment, not just local demo

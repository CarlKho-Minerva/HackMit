## HOOK: The Video That Proves Everything (0:00 - 0:20)
**[PLAY your Veo-3 intro video immediately - let it run 10 seconds]**

**[Switch to camera/yourself]**

> "This video was created in 30 seconds with AI. But here's the thing - after you generate a video, then what? You still need professional editing, captions, publishing. That's a massive gap in the market."

**[Switch to app home screen]**

> "So I built the complete pipeline. Viral-Veo - from idea to viral content in minutes."

## THE EXPLAINER: Show What You Built (0:20 - 1:35)

### The Problem (0:20 - 0:30)
**[App home screen with video gallery visible]**

> "Look at this gallery. These are real videos I generated with Google's Veo-3 - the most advanced video AI available. But generating is just step one. The real challenge is the complete workflow."

### The Solution: Complete Pipeline (0:30 - 1:00)
**[Click on a video to open Remotion editor]**

> "This is where most AI demos end - with a raw video file. But I built a professional video editor using Remotion. Watch this..."

**[Show the editor interface - timeline, captions, controls]**

> "Timeline scrubbing, precision captions, multiple aspect ratios. I can export this for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram - all from one interface."

**[Switch aspect ratio quickly to show 9:16 vs 16:9]**

> "Same video, optimized for every platform. But here's the real magic..."

### The Publishing Power (1:00 - 1:20)
**[Click the YouTube publish button to show modal]**

> "One-click publishing to YouTube. Real OAuth integration, metadata control, automatic cloud storage. This isn't a prototype - it's production infrastructure."

**[Alt-tab to your YouTube channel]**

> "Proof. These videos are live on my channel. All generated with Veo-3, edited with my platform, and published automatically."

### The Technology (1:20 - 1:35)
**[Scroll through your published videos]**

> "In 36 hours, I integrated Google's latest AI model, built professional editing tools with Remotion, and created a complete cloud publishing pipeline. React, TypeScript, Express.js, Google Cloud Storage - this is real infrastructure."

## THE VISION: Why This Matters (1:35 - 2:00)
**[Back to app home screen]**

> "This represents the future of content creation. We're moving from AI that generates content to AI that creates complete, professional, ready-to-publish media."

**[Confident close with your logo/name visible]**

> "Viral-Veo doesn't just generate videos - it generates viral content. The infrastructure is built, the demos are real, and this is just the beginning."
